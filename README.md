# RCNN for car

## Introduction

This is a machine learning project which leverage RCNN model to detect multiple objects in an image. Specifically, the model will receive an image and spot out cars on the image.

## Model

The RCNN model follow the idea of these steps:

1. Searching for regions that may have objects (called region proposal)
2. Crop each region as a separate image
3. Feed those images to a CNN model

## Usage

Regardings the pre-trained model, we have splitted it into 10 parts in `models`. Please first use a joiner tool (example [pinetool](https://pinetools.com/join-files)) to join those file into `best_linear_svm_alexnet_car.pth`.

Then, you need to install all the requirement libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Subsequently, using streamlit to host our website:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
